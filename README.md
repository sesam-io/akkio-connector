# Akkio Connector 

Proof-of-concept connector to a write-only analytics system [Akkio](https://docs.akkio.com/akkio-docs/rest-api/api-options/curl-commands).



[x] connect to system
[x] make collecting of datasets work
[] make sharing of datasets work

Note: Akkio has a pretty absurd way to add [rows to the datasets](https://docs.akkio.com/akkio-docs/rest-api/api-options/curl-commands#add-rows-to-dataset), so we'll have to figure that out.
